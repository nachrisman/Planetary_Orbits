We did the driver and navigator code writing with Nate as the driver and Brian and Kelsie as navigators. Brian and Nate worked on the velocity verlet integrator.

Brian worked on fixing bugs in the code to try to pass all the tests. Kelsie also worked on bug fixing.

Kelsie worked on the hw05 file and getting the code to import properly.
